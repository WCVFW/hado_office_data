            The **Nidhi Company registration** process, governed by the Nidhi Rules, 2014, and the Companies Act, 2013, outlines a structured framework for entities focused on promoting savings and lending within a member-based model. It involves securing a Digital Signature Certificate (**DSC**) and Director Identification Number (**DIN**), obtaining name approval from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (**MCA**), and filing key documents like the Memorandum of Association (**MoA**) and Articles of Association (**AoA**) via Form SPICe+ to obtain a Certificate of Incorporation.

            A Nidhi Company is a specialised type of **non-banking financial company (NBFC)** in India that aims to cultivate savings and financial discipline among its members. It functions by accepting deposits exclusively from its members and providing loans to them, fostering mutual financial growth and community resource pooling. Nidhi Companies are regulated under the Companies Act, 2013, and follow specific guidelines set by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).
