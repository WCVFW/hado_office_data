      An **investment pitch deck** is a presentation used by startups to raise capital from investors. It typically includes **10-15 slides** that outline the company's problem, solution, market opportunity, team, traction, financials, and funding needs.
    </p>
    <p className="max-w-4xl mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700">
      Pitch deck designs should be clean, professional, and visually appealing. The pitch deck for investors should be **tailored to the specific audience** (e.g., angel investors focus on high returns, VCs focus on scalability). A business pitch is a short presentation that summarises the key points of your investment pitch deck.
