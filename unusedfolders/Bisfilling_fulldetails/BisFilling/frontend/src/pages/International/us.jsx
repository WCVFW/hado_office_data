  { q: "Can a non-resident register a company in the USA?", a: "Yes, non-residents can register a company (typically an LLC or C-Corp) in the USA without being a U.S. citizen or permanent resident." },
  { q: "Which is the best state to incorporate a company in the USA?", a: "Delaware is popular for C-Corps aiming for VC funding due to its established corporate law. Wyoming is popular for LLCs due to lower fees and privacy." },
  { q: "How long does it take to incorporate in the USA?", a: "Incorporation can take as little as 1-5 working days, with the EIN application process typically taking 1-2 weeks, depending on the IRS backlog and the non-resident status." },
  { q: "What is an EIN and why is it needed?", a: "The EIN (Employer Identification Number) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the IRS to business entities for tax purposes. It's necessary for hiring employees, opening a bank account, and filing taxes." },
  { q: "Is a US bank account mandatory for foreign founders?", a: "While not legally mandatory to register the company, it is essential for business operations, processing payments, and managing U.S. financial transactions." },
  { q: "What are the annual maintenance requirements?", a: "Requirements typically include filing an Annual Report (or similar state form) and paying the annual Franchise Tax (varies by state), plus filing federal tax returns with the IRS." },
  { q: "Do I need to visit the USA to start a company?", a: "No, U.S. company registration, EIN acquisition, and often bank account opening can all be completed 100% online for non-residents." },
  { q: "Can I open an LLC as a single owner?", a: "Yes, you can form a Single-Member LLC." },
  { q: "What are the tax implications of a US LLC or C-Corp?", a: "LLCs often have 'pass-through' taxation, meaning income is taxed at the owner's level. C-Corps are subject to 'double taxation' (corporate tax and tax on dividends). Consult an expert for precise advice." },
  { q: "What is a separate legal entity, and why does it matter in company registration?", a: "A separate legal entity (like an LLC or Corporation) means the business is legally distinct from its owners, protecting the owners from the business's debts and liabilities." },
  { q: "Which business entity should I choose: LLC, Corporation, or S Corp?", a: "C-Corp is best for fundraising and growth; LLC is best for simplicity and flexibility; S-Corp is restricted to US residents/citizens." },
